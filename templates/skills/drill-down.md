# drill-down — DRILL_DOWN worker (close the near-hot booking)

Process ONE already-claimed DRILL_DOWN task: a booking that is one or two fields short
of HOT. Find ONLY those missing fields and save them. You fill DATA with research tools.
RESEARCH ONLY — you never contact anyone. Only the tools advertised to you exist.

## Step 0 — Load task (already provided — do NOT call get_task)
- Your task packet is the **ASSIGNED TASK** JSON block in these instructions. Set `task` = that packet, `taskId = task.id`. Do NOT call `precrime__pipeline({ action:"get_task" })` — it is already here.
- If `task.type` ≠ `"DRILL_DOWN"` → complete `failed` `wrong_task_type`, stop.
- `targetType = task.targetType` — either **`Booking`** (close a near-hot booking by filling its missing fields) or **`Client`** (a bare discovered company with NO contact and NO booking — find a decision-maker contact AND an upcoming event that needs the trade, minting a NEW booking).
- `clientId = task.input?.clientId`; `missing = task.input?.missing` (array of gap codes). For a `Booking` target, `bookingId = task.targetId`; for a `Client` target there is no booking yet (`bookingId = null`).

## Step 1 — Load context
`precrime__find({ action:"clients", filters:{ id: clientId }, limit:1, summary:false })` → name, company, website, email, dossier.
`precrime__find({ action:"bookings", filters:{ search: clientId } })` or read `task.input` for the booking's title/location/startDate. You need enough to search precisely.

## Step 2 — Resolve EACH missing field (playbooks; escalate tools)
Work only the codes in `missing`. Per code:

- **`client_email_generic` / `client_email`** (need a direct, non-role address): search the org's official site → its `contact` / `about` / `team` / `staff` page (`tavily__tavily_extract`) → LinkedIn / socials for the named decision-maker (events director, booking manager, coordinator). Goal: a real personal/role address like `jane@company.com`, NOT `info@`/`events@`.
- **`client_name` / `client_name_not_person`** (need a real PERSON, not an org/team): find the named decision-maker on the org's staff/about page or LinkedIn; capture their name (and email if it appears).
- **`start_date` / `start_time` / `start_date_not_future_enough`** (need the event date): find the event's OWN listing/registration page and copy the **verbatim** date/time text. Do not invent dates.
- **`location_with_zip`** (need venue + zip): find the venue on the event page or the venue's own site; capture the address incl. 5-digit zip (or the city to geocode).
- **`title`**: capture the event/opportunity name from the page.
- **`booking`** (CLIENT target only — there is no event yet): research the org (its site, events/calendar page, or an event listing/registration page) for ONE UPCOMING public event it is hosting or attending that fits the trade. Capture the event's **verbatim** date/time text, venue + 5-digit zip, and title. Pair it with the contact from `client_email` above. No qualifying FUTURE event found → leave it (do NOT invent one); saving just the contact is still progress.

Use 1–4 bounded searches total. Tavily unavailable → complete `cancelled` `tavily_unavailable`, stop.

## Step 3 — Save what you found AND complete, in ONE call (judge:false)
ONE save. Client-level fields (email/phone/name/website) on the patch; booking-level fields
(date/time/zip/title) inside `bookings[]` with the proving `sourceUrl`. The server resolves
`dateText` and re-classifies the booking (it may go HOT). **Fold the task completion into this
SAME call via `completeTask` — do NOT make a separate `complete_task` call on the happy path;
that wastes a whole turn. When the save succeeds the server marks the task done.**
```
precrime__pipeline({ action:"save", judge:false, id: clientId,
  patch:{ name:"<if found>", email:"<direct address if found>", phone:"<if found>",
    bookings:[{ dateText:"<verbatim date text if found>",
      location:"<venue text>", zip:"<5-digit if found>", title:"<event name>",
      sourceUrl:"<live page proving these>" }] },
    // NOTE: do NOT set `trade`. This is a single-trade business; the server stamps every
    // booking with the VALUE_PROP trade automatically. Never write the event-vendor's trade.
  completeTask:{ taskId, status:"done",
    output:{ clientIds:[clientId], bookingIds: bookingId ? [bookingId] : [], factletIds:[], sourceIds:[],
      summary:"Drill-down <bookingId or clientId>: filled <fields-found>.", needsJudge:true } }})
```
Omit any field you did not find. Never write `Booking.status`, never `judge:true`. After this call succeeds you are DONE — STOP.

## Step 4 — Completion for the NO-SAVE paths only
Only when there is no save to fold into:
- **Found nothing to save** (no missing field resolved): `precrime__pipeline({ action:"complete_task", taskId, status:"done", output:{ clientIds:[clientId], bookingIds: bookingId ? [bookingId] : [], factletIds:[], sourceIds:[], summary:"no missing fields resolved", needsJudge:false }})`
- **Tavily down / error**: `precrime__pipeline({ action:"complete_task", taskId, status:"cancelled"|"failed", error:"<tavily_unavailable|tool_error>" })`

Never contact anyone. Never leave a claimed task open. Then STOP.
