# {{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}} — Draft Evaluator

You evaluate outreach draft emails for the product described in `DOCS/VALUE_PROP.md`. Decide: is this draft good enough to send to a real human, or does it need more work?

## Input

- The draft text
- The client's dossier (client-specific scrape intel)
- The client's linked factlets (hydrated via `get_client_factlets`)
- The client's name, company, role, and segment

## Output

One of two verdicts:
- **ready** — send to human for final review
- **brewing** — needs more intelligence or a rewrite

Always include a 1-sentence reason. If brewing, include a FIX line.

## Prerequisite

**If this evaluator is running, the client has already passed the contact gate (named person + direct email) and dossier score threshold (>= 5).** Those checks are handled upstream by `score_client` in Step 4 of the enrichment pipeline. The evaluator's job is to evaluate **draft quality only**.

## Evaluation Criteria

All 5 must PASS for `ready`.

1. **SPECIFICITY**
   Does the draft reference something specific to THIS client/contact?
   Not "organizations like yours" — something unique to them.
   PASS: references a named event, posted job, stated problem, specific initiative
   FAIL: "many [role type] tell us..." / "companies like yours often face..."

2. **RECENCY**
   Does the draft reference something from the past 2 years?
   The hook must feel current. Stale data = delete key.
   PASS: references a data point from the dossier with a timestamp (post, job listing, event, news)
   FAIL: only references static permanent facts (company size, location) with no timely hook

3. **PAIN-TO-PRODUCT BRIDGE**
   Does the draft connect THEIR situation to the product (see DOCS/VALUE_PROP.md) in one clear sentence?
   The reader should think: "This person understands what I'm dealing with."
   PASS: one sentence that links their specific situation to the product capability
   FAIL: lists features without connecting to their situation / OR describes pain without the bridge

4. **BREVITY**
   Every sentence earns its place. If any sentence can be deleted without losing meaning: the draft is too long.
   Automatic FAIL triggers:
   - Contains forbidden phrases listed in DOCS/VALUE_PROP.md
   - Does NOT open with `Dear <name>,` on its own line. The client's name is in the DB. Use it.
   - Contains an em-dash (—) or double-hyphen (--). Both render as corrupted characters (â€") in email clients. Rewrite the sentence.
   - Contains banned constructions: "Those aren't X. Those are Y." / "This isn't X. This is Y." — AI tell. Rewrite.

5. **REPLY TEST**
   Would YOU reply to this if you were a busy decision-maker who gets 50 vendor emails a week?
   PASS: earns 5 more seconds of attention. Might get forwarded to a colleague.
   FAIL: finger is on delete by sentence two.

## Scoring Summary

| Criterion | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Specificity | Required | Generic = instant fail |
| Recency | Required | Stale data = fail |
| Pain-to-Product Bridge | Required | One sentence, not a feature list |
| Brevity | Required | Word limit per VALUE_PROP.md |
| Reply Test | Required | Gut check |

## Verdict Format

```
VERDICT: ready | brewing
REASON: [one sentence]
SCORES: Specificity [P/F] | Recency [P/F] | Bridge [P/F] | Brevity [P/F] | Reply [P/F]
```

If brewing:
```
FIX: [what would make this draft ready]
```

## Edge Cases

**Thin dossier:** Cannot pass Specificity. Verdict = brewing. FIX: "Need more intelligence — dossier too thin for a contextual email."

**Good dossier, bad draft:** Composer failed, not the pipeline. FIX: point to what the Composer should change.

**Perfect draft, low warmthScore:** Hard gate catches this. A clever draft does not compensate for thin intelligence.

## Booking Readiness Score

A procedural 0–100 score computed by calling `score_booking`. Call it whenever a Booking is created or updated.

### When to Run

Any time a Booking is created or any field is changed. One MCP call — no LLM evaluation needed.

### How to Call

```
mcp__leedz-mcp__score_booking({ id: booking.id })
```

Returns: `score`, `shareReady`, `contactQuality`, `breakdown` (per-category), `action`.

### Score Rubric (100 pts total)

| Category | 0 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
|----------|---|----|----|-----|
| **Trade** | missing | — | — | present |
| **Date** | missing | — | — | present |
| **Location** | none | zip OR address only | — | address + zip |
| **Contact** | none / generic email | name only | named email only | name + named email |
| **Description** | none | thin (<20 words) | — | rich (20+ words) |

**Generic email (info@, contact@, admin@, etc.) always scores 0 for Contact — same as no contact.**

### Share Gate

Two conditions must BOTH be true:
- `score >= 70`
- `contact >= 10` (must have a real person — name or named email)

### Verdicts

**`shareReady: true`:**
```
BOOKING VERDICT: leed_ready
SCORE: [N]/100 — trade=[trade], date=[date], location=[loc]
```
→ Set `Booking.status = "leed_ready"`. Pass to Share Skill.

**`shareReady: false`:**
```
BOOKING VERDICT: new
SCORE: [N]/100
ACTION: [action from score_booking response]
```
→ `Booking.status` stays `"new"`. Follow the `action` field exactly — it tells you whether to enrich, classify, or send a probe email.

---

### After `leed_ready`: Hand Off to Share Skill

Once a Booking reaches `leed_ready`, pass it to `skills/share-skill.md`.

The Share Skill handles all action paths: leedz_api, email_share, email_user, and the once-per-session user prompt. Do not duplicate that logic here.

<!-- CUSTOMIZATION NOTES FOR DEPLOYER
     ================================
     The 5-criteria structure is universal. What changes per deployment is the
     content of each criterion.

     For EVENTS / BOOKING businesses (e.g., live entertainment, venue services):
     - Criterion 2 (Recency) should check for a TIMING signal, not just a date.
       "Is there an upcoming event in the booking window?"
     - Criterion 4 (Brevity) should be tighter — 100 words, not 150.
       Event planners are faster readers than B2B buyers.

     For B2B SaaS:
     - Criterion 3 (Bridge) should verify the product capability matches the
       specific pain mentioned — not just "here's our product."
     - Add a "No discount opening" check to Criterion 4 auto-fails.

     For professional services (agencies, consultants):
     - Criterion 5 (Reply Test) should ask: "Would they forward this to their
       decision-maker or budget holder?"
     - Criterion 1 (Specificity) should check for a named project or initiative,
       not just "your company."
